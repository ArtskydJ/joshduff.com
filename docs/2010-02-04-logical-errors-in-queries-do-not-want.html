<p>One particular error that I've seen time and time again (even from people who have been writing queries for a while) can occur when summarizing data from multiple tables that have a one-to-many relationship.</p>
<p>...In other words, it could occur in queries written for most database-driven software.</p>
<h2 id="solution-fix-the-problem-by-writing-about-it">Solution: fix the problem by writing about it!</h2>
<p>I wrote <a href="http://wikido.isoftdata.com/index.php/The_GROUPing_pitfall">a page documenting</a> the cause of the logical error, doing my best to warn people against letting it slip into their own code.</p>
<p>I attempted to write it so it would be easy to read, possibly even entertaining (a lofty goal for a manual on writing database queries, perhaps) - there is some colorful language and plenty of juvenile humor mixed with the tech-speak.</p>
<p>The doc itself is part of the wiki of the company where I work.  I don't write a ton of documentation for our developers or customers (certainly not as much as I should), but whenever I do, I get this awesome feeling of usefulness.  Oh, and pride.  Sometimes, I feel so proud, that I feel compelled to link other people (who have no relationship to my company) to what I wrote!  Ridiculous, I know.</p>
<p>Remember: if you write queries, it is your responsibility to guarantee that they return true and accurate data!</p>
