This is my home page!  A far cry from the tripod-hosted html of my youth.  I actually pay for hosting now!

[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TehShrike) or [on app.net](https://alpha.app.net/tehshrike) to read short sentences and occasional snippets of internet gold that I mine from the depths.

I make software!  You can read my public code [on Github](https://github.com/TehShrike).  I wrote the software running this web site.  See how quickly the pages load when you click the links in the menu!  oooh, aaah.  It's called Noddity, [you can try it yourself if you like](http://noddity.com/).
