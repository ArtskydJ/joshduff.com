Some time in 2012, I decided to write my own blogging platform in JavaScript.  I hashed out my goals with a friend over an evening.  "It'll be simple," I said.  "You'll make changes to a directory full of Markdown files, and that's your blog!  I should be able to write the prototype in one evening!"

If you want to read some mediocre code from early in my JavaScript career, that prototype code is [on the internet](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/commit/c91ee844b55f9cb2cfe809b9b3666536ba8cc9e7).  I was still figuring out Node.js best practices, and dipping my feet into functional programming.

It took a surprising amount of work to write something that could replace Wordpress as my blogging platform, let alone something that somebody else could conceivably download and use.

What should it even be?
=========

My specific goals didn't even solidify until after I'd started writing it.  I settled on

1. static file deployments (no server-side code, deployable on Github or shared http hosting)
2. no build step to turn markdown into html
3. being able to browse to new pages without waiting for a round-trip to the server

I had dream features as well - things I thought all content sites should have, that I really wanted on my blog-site.  Interestingly, these features all come from MediaWiki.

An edit button on every page
------

I've been a Wikipedia editor for a good number of years now, and my first instinct when I see poor spelling or grammar (or, God forbid, overly-long paragraphs begging for some newlines) is to click an edit button and fix the problem.  Most sites with typos don't have an edit button.

My posts may have typos, but I want anyone to be able to feel the cathartic satisfaction of fixing someone else's mistakes on the internet.

Easy linking to other pages
------

I shouldn't have to think about the deployment environment when I link to one of my other posts.  When I link to another post I've written, it should be by the file name, and nothing more.

Having to link to `#!/my-awesome-posts/some-file.md` - or, if I want the link to work in RSS feeds and on other sites, `http://mysite.com/blog/#!/my-awesome-posts/some-file.md` - is unacceptable.  I need wiki-style `[link.md|linking]`.

Embeddable templates
------

This is, in my mind, MediaWiki/Wikipedia's killer feature.  You can embed any page in any other page - and, since you can pass parameters to an embedded a page, you can use this single feature to build a domain-specific language for writing content pages.

I got to dig in to MediaWiki templates a bit when I was administrating the [MediaWiki documentation site for my previous employer](http://wikido.isoftdata.com), and I was totally sold on the feature.

Allowing embeddable templates would give me the power without heavy PHP site and archaic MediaWiki formatting syntax.

Work that other people did for me
=======

I planned on using Substack's [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) as my module/build system from very early on, which freed me from worrying about what code I would have to rewrite in order to reuse the client-side code in my RSS and static file servers.

DOM manipulation was not something I had any intention of rewriting, so I decided to try Rich Harris's sweet [RactiveJS](http://www.ractivejs.org/) library.  When I realized that Ractive's mustache syntax would be the perfect way to handle sweet code in embedded templates, life got even awesomer.

Even though the blog itself runs without any server-side code, it caches post content, and that means storage.  I wrote everything to Rod Vagg's [LevelUP](https://github.com/rvagg/node-levelup) interface, giving me the ideal key-value store.  The exact same code that uses localstorage in the browser is backed by Redis on my RSS/static file servers.

Wait, why would that take so long to implement?
========

Having those goals in mind, I was able to start working on the other tools that I would need to exist.

Astute students of practical computer science will have recognized goal #3 above as something that requires caching, one of the [two hard problems](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html).

While it may have surprised me two years ago, it should not surprise you to hear that most of the code I wrote for Noddity was in the caching layer.

Post metadata
--------

Actually, before I dug into the caching, I started by nailing down the post format.  I needed to formalize a big ball of http-accessible blog content.

I wrote [noddity-retrieval](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity-retrieval) to abstract away accessing a directory full of Markdown files, and [text-metadata-parser](https://github.com/TehShrike/text-metadata-parser)/[weak-type-wizard](https://github.com/TehShrike/weak-type-wizard) to parse metadata from the top lines of my blog post files.

It turns out that putting metadata in plain text isn't a new thing - Jekyll and others use the YAML standard to achieve the same goal, and text-metadata-parser doesn't currently handle those three dashes/dots.  So, I'll likely be deprecating text-metadata-parser, or at least supporting YAML syntax above Noddity content files at some point in the future.  C'est la vie.

Caching
------

Wheeeeeee!  This is one of those things you instinctively know that you shouldn't be rewriting.

Still, I couldn't find a solution on npm (the current winner of [Having Code On The Internet](http://www.modulecounts.com/) that matched my goals:

- Return a value as quickly as possible, regardless of age
- Update the cached value every so often
- Expire keys based on the last time they were requested, not the last time the value changed

So, I wrote [levelup-cache](https://github.com/TehShrike/levelup-cache), and, in what I'm calling my Favorite Abstraction Layer of Noddity, I wrote the [expire-unused-keys](https://github.com/TehShrike/expire-unused-keys) module to take responsibility for knowing when a key needed to be refreshed or dropped.

Since writing it, I've realied that you can use expire-unused-keys as a low-level building block in many caching solutions.  I'm kind of proud of that library.

Next, I wrote [noddity-butler](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity-butler) - which combines knowledge of the noddity-retrieval blog structure with levelup-cache caching return posts from a Noddity content directory (like [joshduff.com/content](http://joshduff.com/content/)) as efficiently as possible.

This is the library that is used by both the client and the RSS/static servers to access a given site's content.

The actual front-end
--------

After assembling those parts on my nights and weekends, I made the real website.  Most of the code by lines was taken up by the "recursively-embedded-posts" logic, which was not nearly as straightforward as it seemed in my head when I decided "hey, I should have embeddable templates!"

Eventually, I wrote [noddity-renderer](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity-renderer), which will turn a Noddity blog post into either static HTML, or recursively infinite Ractive elements that automatically update themselves whenever the noddity-butler reports any changes.

It's, uh, an interesting library.  It turns out "static html" and "a self-updating front-end" do share code, but imply very different layouts to pull off reasonably.  If you can give me any advice on the architecture of [the code](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity-renderer/blob/master/index.js) I'd love to hear it.

"Real" web site features
============

I didn't want to drop Wordpress and replace my real web site with my own creation until I had an RSS feed, and search engines were able to index my individual pages.

The RSS feed wasn't difficult, all it takes is a [link element](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/blob/master/index.html#L11) that refers to some other server that uses Noddity Butler to [turn your posts into an feed](https://github.com/TehShrike/rssaas/blob/master/index.js#L33).

Making the search engines happy with your Web 3.0 single-page app is a bit more involved - you have to add a [special line to your html](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/blob/master/index.html#L13-L18), which tells the search engine spiders to visit a [special url that you have to support](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/docs/specification), in the case of Noddity by using an [.htaccess file](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity/blob/master/.htaccess#L27-L32) to redirect the spiders to a [server capable of serving static html from the Noddity markdown posts](https://github.com/TehShrike/seoaas).

It turned out those two applications shared a lot of code, so I moved it out to the [noddity-service-server](https://github.com/TehShrike/noddity-service-server).  If you ever want to write a node.js server that references a Noddity blog, that's the library you should be using.
