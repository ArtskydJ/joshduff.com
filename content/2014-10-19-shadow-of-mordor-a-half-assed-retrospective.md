title: Shadow of Mordor: an optimistic review by someone not quite halfway through the game
date: 2014-10-19 22:00:00

Shadow of Mordor does something that I don't often see in a triple-A game: it contextualizes the gameplay in a way that makes it vastly more enjoyable.

It shares gameplay mechanics with the Batman Arkham games - satisfying tempo-based bad-guy-hitting broken up by story dumps and voice acting.

In Batman, the primary context to your gameplay was the explicit written narrative delivered from the writers to you by voice acting including Mark Hamill's fantastic Joker.

Shadow of Mordor botches this horribly, its written narrative draining fun and motivation from the game whenever you encounter it.

But unlike the Batman games, Shadow of Mordor provides another major context for progress through gameplay - one that I remember best from the indie game Mount & Blade.

When all you have is a sword
=========

Mount & Blade features swing-and-block skill-based gameplay, but with more emphasis on timing and aim than Shadow of Mordor or Batman.  Unlike those games, it lacks almost any written narrative at all.

But the implicit narrative is very strong.  You have a weapon.  You have a horse.  You are surrounded by cities and nations with large armies.  You may battle any of the robbers, armies, or cities around you, but as one man, you are easily beaten.

The first time I played, I ran into a handful of robbers and instantly ran at them with my sword.  I think I hit two of them before they beat me down, and a text block informed me that I had slaved under their command for eight months before I could escape.

Recruit a few men, challenge a small group of robbers.  Lose some men, gain some supplies.  Make it to the next town to by food.

You are not driven by saving the world.  The question is, can you survive?  Can you thrive?

Oh hellz yeah I can thrive
========

Earning my way to being able to threaten whole cities and king's armies was extremely satisfying.  And judging from the success of the Day Z/Rust genre, plenty of other players share my compulsion.

This is the game that Shadow of Mordor has stumbled into: beyond hitting things and collectables and exposition-by-cutscene, it gives you a world full of challenges that are not motivated by any written story.

As I play, Urak society is constantly training up new leaders to take me on.  Many of them beat me, in fact.  The writers didn't make that droog a mini-boss, I made him a miniboss when I tried to swing at him instead of dodging.  Killing me gains him reputation and power, putting one more piece on a game board full of opponents.

The captains go about their business regardless of you, or the written story.  Left alone, they fight amongst themselves to gain even more power.  Whether you level up by challenging the big captains or picking flowers is up to you.

Named enemies
========

Like Mount & Blade, Shadow of Mordor lets me win that satisfying feeling of setting my eyes on a foe and fighting until I can challenge and take them down.

Unlike any other game I can remember, though, Shadow of Mordor brings a triple-A polish to that same experience.

In Mount & Blade, I recruited unique named characters with their own strengths, backstories and relationships with each other.  They cared about whether or not I attacked certain factions, or whether I let merchants live.  But my personal relationship with them never grew beyond "spear guy" "sword lady" and "archer dude".

Shadow of Mordor's bad guys are similarly procedurally generated, but the attributes that the game rolls up for them are differences that it is impossible not to care about.  Not for their expertly-written backstories, but because they all relate directly to the NPC's ability to survive your attack and kill you.

Calling someone a "beastmaster" and giving them a fur coat is all well and good, but when my enemy one-shots a caragor that I send after him, I start to take their character a bit more seriously, even if it does boil down to a title and a bullet-point list of skills and flaws.

Another excellent way that Shadow of Mordor sets itself apart from the Batman series is by extending the unique character generation to the nameless droogs.  Batman had the luxury of fighting the same ten guys over and over, but I have to worry about whether or not this urak grunt is going to be able to toss me on my ass when I try to flip over him.

Is it enough?
=========

I haven't even gotten to the gameplay feature that people seem to most enjoy - claiming urak to join your side and take position among the other captains.  If you want a big grin on your face, check out [Tom Francis talking about his crew](http://www.pentadact.com/2014-10-18-what-works-and-why-saurons-army/).

Unlocking that could keep me involved in the world for a good while longer, but the rest of the game does make it hard.  [Shamus Young's takedown of the written storytelling](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/12479-Shadow-of-Mordor-is-Tawdry-Tolkien-Fanfiction) is accurate.  The only good part so far has been the song Gollum sang about how he wanted to stab me.

As I keep levelling up, I have started to feel like I could probably take most of the captains now.  This removes a lot of the context that actually makes the game fun - I can understand why a [no-upgrades run](http://nowrongwaytoplay.tumblr.com/post/99486423288/shadow-of-mordor-permadeath-no-upgrades-run) would be more rewarding.

Worst of all, I have to play a character who, unlike me, cares not about taking on challenging opponents, but only the wholesale slaughter of a race for the purposes of misplaced revenge.

In Mount & Blade my character was businesslike and effective, going toe to toe with other sword-swinging knights.  Shadow of Mordor's Talion constantly speaks of his enemies with derision and revels in gutting them.

Cautiously optimistic
=========

Shadow of Mordor has broken new ground in turning open-world gameplay into the sweet sweet crack that gamers want.  They stumbled on a gameplay contextualization a step above what other big-label games have been using (ala Grand Theft Auto's "isn't it sweet to grab any care you want and drive around really fast").

It's encouragind to see a big-budget game with such great player motivation in its game world.  I hope to see more publisher-funded titles trying to copy these ideas in the future.
