title: Shadow of Mordor: an optimistic review by someone not quite halfway through the game
date: 2014-10-19 22:00:00

Shadow of Mordor has given me more enjoyment than most other triple-A games I've played over the last decade.

It has its flaws (I'm looking forward to reading an angry rant from Shamus Young tomorrow), but the open-world full of enemies is a better sandbox than I expected,and I haven't even unlocked the mind-controlling recruitment ability that everyone seems to think is the coolest part of the game.

The Good
========

The combat plays like one of the Batman: Arkham games, and you won't catch me complaining about that design decision.  Still, "good" is about the most approbative title I can muster.  It's basically what you'd expect after either Batman game, though the sword-based combat does seem a bit less punchy (sorry).

SoM does have one notable advantage over Batman combat: it's easier to get hit.  The thugs in Arkham attack Batman with a nice rhythm, turning combat into a ballet-based DDR starring a man in a bat-suit, while the Uraks in Mordor don't feel the need to let you finish your cool move before they swing at your face.

Result: I enjoy the combat, and I die a lot.  When a schmuk kills me, he gets promoted and grows more powerful, which is cool.  What's more, he'll gain prestige with the other baddies and will insult me the next time I run into him, which is way more fun than the too-common death punishment of having to start from a save point 30 minutes ago.

The urak-personality system is the game's strong points.  Every enemy, even the no-name droogs, has a procedurally-generated set of attributes.  They all look different.  You can watch them fight and start to identify the skills that they have.  The named captains at the upper tiers of Urak society have more strength, hit points, and perks that make them difficult to kill.

It's accurate to say that the Urak NPCs have more character than most RPG sidekicks, and I think the meaningful attributes are key - calling someone a "beastmaster" and giving them a fur coat are all well and good, but when your enemy one-shots a caragor that you send after him, you start to take their character a bit more seriously, even if it is boiled down to a title and a bullet-point list of skills and flaws.

Battle and prestige in a world that doesn't care about you
----------

In its best moments, Shadow of Mordor reminds me less of the Batman games than it does Mount & Blade.

The Mount & Blade tutorial was minimal, and after swinging some weapons around I was out on the open map with a horse.  I ran into a group of 5 robbers.  I engaged.  Duh.  When you are The Protagonist, why turn down the XP?

I think I did damage to maybe 2 of them before they chopped me down, and a text block informed me that I had slaved under their command for eight months before I could escape.

Making me work for the combat is a good selling point, but that was just the tip of the hook.  Over the next two hours, I built up a small force of mediocre warriors and could attack groups of as many as 10 or 15 petty criminals without dying.

Meanwhile, armies of 300 knights roamed around me.  Building an army that could challenge them was arduous, and extremely satisfying.

In Mount & Blade, you find unique characters who will join your side, with backstories and relationships with each other.  They care about whether or not you attack certain factions or let merchants live.  There are named mayors who you can anger.  But they are a less compelling motivation to me than the world map of cities and nations that opposed me, and were beyond my grasp.

In Mount & Blade, kings fight each other in giant battles without caring about your group.  You pick fights with the biggest baddie you think you can handle at the time.

Shadow of Mordor is the first game since Mount & Blade to give me the feeling that I'm fighting my way up a hierarchy of power among characters with larger swords than mine.

As an aside, I would like to note that Mount & Blade was created by a husband and wife development team in Turkey, and the Wikipedia page for Monolith Development lists the number of employees as "100+".

Enemy characters
----------

My motivation in Mount & Blade is to build a large army and find enough food to keep my army happy.  Thus, the other characters in the world are defined by the number of soldiers they can attack me with, and how much food they're carrying.  The game occasionally gives them other attributes, but they never matter to me.

Shadow of Mordor motivates me to kill the largest urak-hai I can handle, and gives them distinguishing traits that directly relate to my ability to kill them.

It's overstating it a bit to say that the enemy characters are deep, but I'm impressed to find myself caring more about chasing down a procedurally-generated urak than a classic Batman villain.

The PC port
-----------

Surprisingly good.

[The menus don't suck](https://twitter.com/nickbreckon/status/518188778855600130), performance detection is excellent, and any DRM is non-visible.

I have to run the game at low graphical settings due to my older graphics card, but the frame rate is smooth.

Shadow of Mordor's non-shittiness stands in stark contrast to almost every other major cross-platform game I've played in the last ten years.

The Bad
=======

Maybe I'm just getting old, but eviscerating flesh just doesn't excite me like it used... no, I guess it never excited me much.

It didn't bother me much for the first few hours.  I've played enough video game characters with giant bowel-removing swords to not be shocked.  But Talion is always so energetic about it, and even worse, the game loves to highlight the decapitations and disembowelments.

I avoid upgrading/using the "brutalize" ability.  Playing Batman and permanently disabling mentally ill people is one thing, but in a game that manages to give NPCs some character, I'm still not comfortable with how I murdered an urak surnamed "The Gentle".

It was you all along
-------

While we're on the subject, Talion is just a really horrible person.  The scripted spawning-into-the-world chatter between him and his shoulder-ghost friend include lines about how "any amount of brutality is justified" as long as it furthers his cause.

However racist you think Lord of the Rings is, Talion doubles down on racial genocide.  There is no justification of the means, only his desire to abuse and use uraks to achieve a goal that the cutscenes still haven't managed to make clear to me.

I'm 12 hours in to the story, and I'm still not sure if his characterization is self-aware or oblivious.  Did the writers intend to write an unlikeable anti-hero, or is that just a side effect of picking a cliched hero off the shelf?

The story
---------

Many have noted the weak story, I won't belabor the point.  There was no need to take such a fine game and shoehorn it into the Tolkien universe.

The best part of the written story so far has been the song Gollum sang about how he wanted to stab me.

Stop me if you've heard this one before: beefy white soldier-bro gets revenge by indiscriminately murdering The Other.

I don't think it's wrong to ask for some variation in a world where I can step into the mind of an [animated introspective tetris piece](http://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/).

The best attribute of the story so far has been its ability to stay out of the way of my open-world fun.

The Wistful
===========

I wish I could play Shadow of Mordor as an urak.  Not necessarily a normal captain fighting his way up the hierarchy, I'm fine with some amount of protagonist privilege - maybe you're a young uruk who read one too many revolutionary books at orc-college or whatever, and now you're taking down the system from the inside.

Anything to frame my character as an underdog fighting his way up in the world instead of Chosen Stabber of Bad Guys.

The flaws in story and character framing will likely keep Shadow of Mordor from being considered a classic (even without [the quick-time events I've been instructed to dread)](https://twitter.com/shamusyoung/status/523191599854264320).

But when a major publisher's game has the ability to [act as a story-generator](http://www.pentadact.com/2014-10-18-what-works-and-why-saurons-army/) rivaling FTL or Spelunky, that's worth lauding.  I'm excited for the sequel, whatever universe it's story ends up in.

Shadow of Mordor strips down the over-writing of antagonist characters, and lets you struggle against procedurally generated NPCs in an open world.  Hopefully, other studios will copy those features and strip out the other cliches holding the game back.
