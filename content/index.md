I make software, mostly for businesses.  Feel free to [peruse my resume](https://github.com/TehShrike/resume).

I've written more code than words on the internet in recent years.  If you like JavaScript, [follow me on Github](https://github.com/TehShrike/)!

Here are a few projects of mine you might want to check out:

- [Noddity](http://noddity.com), the blog/wiki platform running this site
- [abstract-state-router](https://github.com/TehShrike/abstract-state-router), for building large webapps
- [communalchecklist.com](http://communalchecklist.com), a gift registry/checklist without all the fluff

You can [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/TehShrike).
