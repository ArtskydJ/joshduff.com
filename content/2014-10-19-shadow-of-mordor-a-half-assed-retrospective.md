title: Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor: a half-assed retrospection
date: 2014-10-19 22:00:00

Fallout 3 burned me pretty badly.  I eagerly and optimistically followed the hype in the years leading up to its release, and preordered the game about as soon as the option was available on Steam.  Would the game live up to its predecessors and successfully deliver on a first-person Fallout experience?

Well, I never found out first-hand.  The game would not play on my modern (recent Nvidia, Intel) PC hardware, and no amount of driver-updating and download-patching would stop the game from crashing to the desktop within 10-20 minutes of launching.

My bitterness was roughly equivalent to that of a third-generation family feud, and only deepened as those lucky enough to own a magical combination of components that would launch the game reported that the game was, in fact, super-fun and I really was missing out.

Thus began my policy of never paying full price for triple-A games from major publishers.  Exceptions so far: Batman Arkham City (the sequel to the impressive Arkham Asylum which I'd bought for a few bucks during a Steam sale), and Rocksmith 2014 (because BASS GUITAR).

And now Shadow of Mordor.

The first gameplay demo I saw was from E3 (or equivalent).  It featured canned gameplay and promised way too much.  There's no way they could deliver on those promises and it was probably only going to come out on XBox and Playstation anyway.

Many moons later, the day before the game released, I watched [Mike Krahulik's stream of a demo build](http://www.twitch.tv/cwgabriel/b/573352594), and it looked sweet.  He got killed by low-level droogs, rode around on giant monsters, and sent a mind-controlled captain to try to assasinate some other guy.  I want to do all those things.

I check, and the game is coming out on PC.  I tell myself I can wait for a sale.  I see a tweet [praising its PC options](https://twitter.com/nickbreckon/status/518188778855600130)(!).  The NeoGAF forum thread seems positive and doesn't complain about the quality of the PC port.  A good friend tells me that the game is great if you're into Batman: Arkham combat (oh am I!).  I buy the game at full price.

Was it worth it?  Yes it was, and I'll tell you why.  But first, an excuse (I mean, uh, qualifier): I haven't played the whole game yet.  I've gotten in about 12 hours of gameplay so far, and the "story completion percentage" puts me at nearly halfway done.  I've seen several people complain that the best gameplay hook, the mind-control ability, is gated behind half the story missions, and I haven't even unlocked it yet.

Thus the subtitle "half-assed".  But there's enough meat in Shadow of Mordor for me to be able to pick a post out from between my teeth, and I sort of want to get this post written while I'm still so high on the game, since it sounds like [the story gets even worse](https://twitter.com/shamusyoung/status/523260079882395648) and [quick-time events become a bigger deal](https://twitter.com/shamusyoung/status/523191599854264320).

The Good
========

The combat.  "Good" seems appropriate.  It's basically what you'd expect after either Batman Arkham game, though the sword-based combat does seem to have a bit less of a punch (sorry).

But SoM does have a notable advantage over Batman combat: it's easier to get hit.  The thugs in Arkham attacked with a nice rhythm, turning combat into a ballet-based DDR starring Batman, while the Uraks in Mordor operate more like how I percieve those turtles that threw hammers at me in Mario: hitting me randomly whenever I'm not careful.

Result: I enjoy the combat, and I die a lot.  And when a schmuk kills me, he gets promoted and grows more powerful, which is cool.  But then sometimes when I'm in the middle of combat, a fellow who killed me once already will run up to me and insult me right before tipping the tides against me so that I die again, which sucks.  And is also kind of awesome.

The urak-personality system is very successful.  Every enemy, even the no-names you stab without thought, has a procedurally-generated set of attributes.  They all look different.  Some of them will knock you on your ass when you try certain moves, and others are scardey cats.

The violent individuals who make up the upper tiers of Urak society are captains with more strength, more hit points, and more perks that make them difficult to kill.  Allegations that the Urak NPCs have more character than most RPG sidekicks are accurate, and I think the meaningful attributes are key - calling someone a "beastmaster" and giving them a fur coat are all well and good, but when your enemy one-shots the caragor that you send after him, you start to take their backstory a bit more seriously.

Battle and prestige in a world that doesn't care about you
----------

In its best moments (which have been most of them for me so far), Shadow of Mordor doesn't remind me of the Batman games as much as it reminds me of Mount & Blade.

I played the Mount & Blade demo because it was a game with sword-fighting that had a demo.  The introduction was minimal, and after swinging some long and blunt/short and sharp implements in a tutorial I was in the open map with a horse.  I ran into a group of 5 robbers.  I engaged.  I mean, duh.  When you are The Protagonist, you don't turn down easy XP like that.

I think I did damage to maybe 2 of them before they chopped me down, and a text block informed me that I had slaved under their command for eight months before I could escape.

Easy death and slavery are good selling points, but they were just the tip of the hook.  Over the next two hours, I built up a small force of mediocre warriors with whom I could attack groups of as many as 10 or 15 petty criminals without dying.

Meanwhile, armies of 300 knights roamed around me, blocking my actions.  The hours of working my way up from nothing to a kingdom-threatening army were long, and some of the more satisfying gameplay experiences I've enjoyed.

M&B had unique characters who would join your side, with backstories and relationships with each other.  They cared about whether or not you attacked certain factions or let merchants go.  There were named leaders who you could anger.  But they all played second-fiddle to the world map of cities and nations that opposed you, and were beyond your grasp.

Shadow of Mordor's gameplay presents a similarly uncaring world.  Unfortunately, the writing does overly play up the player character as the [hero protagonist](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroProtagonist), meaning that you'll sneak by orcs talking about you as if you're all that and a bag of chips, right before blundering into a stronghold to smother in orc-armpits.

Shadow of Mordor is the first game since Mount & Blade to give me the feeling that I'm fighting my way up a hierarchy of power among characters with biggers swords than I.

As an aside, I would like to note that Mount & Blade was created by a husband and wife development team in Turkey, and the Wikipedia page for Monolith Development lists the number of employees as "100+".

Shadow of Mordor gives its urak-hai characters weight with gameplay mechanics that are meaningful even if you kill them right away, and feel momentous when they kill you and antagonize you for several gameplay hours.

I may be exaggerating slightly - if your combat is disciplined and tight, the enemies in the first half of the game may not often feel like a long-term threat.  I can understand why you would stick to a [no-upgrades run](http://nowrongwaytoplay.tumblr.com/post/99486423288/shadow-of-mordor-permadeath-no-upgrades-run) to keep the threat high.

Still, halfway through the game, there's a level 20 Uruk in my game right now that's killed me three times so far, and I'm kind of scared to go after him again.  The last time I went after him I took down his gang and worked him down to within finishing range, but then another captain nemesis of mine ran up and helped him finish me off.

The PC port
-----------

It's easy to talk about the SoM gameplay wins, but in a post that leads off with my Fallout 3 experience, I need to talk about the application experience.

Shadow of Mordor is a top-tier PC game.

The menus don't suck, the graphics options are comprehensive, the performance detection is excellent, and any DRM is non-visible.

I'm running the game at low graphical settings due to my older graphics card, but performance is steady and the frame rate is smooth.

Shadow of Mordor's quality as an application stands in stark contrast to almost every other AAA cross-platform game I've played in the last ten years (for contrast, the Arkham games made me install Games for Windows Live).

The Bad
=======

Maybe I'm just getting old, but eviscerating flesh just doesn't excite me like it used... no, I guess it never excited me much.  I suppose I'm just getting more sensitive to it.

It didn't bother me much at first.  I've played enough video game characters with giant bowel-removing swords to know how video games work.  But Talion is always so energetic with his killing, and... even worse... the game seems to revel in the decapitations and disembowelments too, with the camera shots and attaching gameplay perks to higher levels of violence.

I've found myself avoiding upgrades to the "brutalize" ability and the like.  Having Batman permanently disable mentally ill people is one thing, but in a game that manages to give NPCs some character, I'm still not comfortable with how I murdered an urak surnamed "the gentle".

It was you all along
-------

While we're on the subject, Talion is just really horrible.  The scripted spawning-into-the-world chatter between him and his shoulder-ghost friend include lines about how any amount of brutality is justified as long as it furthers his cause.

Whatever your opinions may be about the extent to which Tolkien wrote racism into the world of Lord of the Rings, Talion has doubled down on racial genocide.  There is no justification, only his desire to abuse and use uraks to achieve a goal that the cutscenes still haven't managed to make clear to me.

I'm 12 hours in to the story, and I'm still not sure if this characterization is self-aware or oblivious.  By contrast, Spec Ops made it crystal clear to me within about 3 hours of murder (spoilers: the monster is you).

The story
---------

Many have noted the weak story, I won't belabor the point.  There was no need to take such a fine game and shoehorn it into the Tolkien universe.

The best part of the written story so far has been the song Gollum sang about how he wanted to stab me.

Stop me if you've heard this one before: beefy white soldier-bro gets revenge by indiscriminately murdering The Other.

I don't think it's wrong to ask for some variation in a world where I can step into the mind of an [animated introspective tetris piece](http://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/).

The best attribute of the story so far has been its ability to stay out of the way of my open-world fun.

The Wistful
===========

I find myself wishing that I could play Shadow of Mordor as an Urak.  Not necessarily as a normal captain fighting is way up the hierarchy, I'm fine with some amount of protagonist privilege - maybe you're a young uruk who read one too many revolutionary books at orc-college or whatever, and now you're taking down the system from the inside.  Or something.

Anything to frame my character as an underdog fighting his way up in the world instead of Chosen Stabber of Bad Guys.

I don't want to diss Monolith too much.  What are the odds that they could get the money to make a game this good without using familiar cliches and being attached to a major franchise like Lord of the Rings?

The flaws in story and character framing will likely keep Shadow of Mordor from being considered a classic (even without the quick-time events I've been instructed to dread).

But when a major publisher game has the ability to act as a story-generator rivaling FTL or Spelunky, that's worth lauding.  I'm excited for the sequel, whatever world it ends up being in - and unlike Assassin's Creed, I'm happy to play the original until the next iteration comes along.
